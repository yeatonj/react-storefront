            <p>This is a mock website of a storefront. It is not meant to be pretty from a styling perspective, but it does have a functioning (client-side...) cart, queries an external API for items, and has buttons for adding things to/from cart. I may come back to this at some point to improve the styling, but for now, this is what it is!</p>
